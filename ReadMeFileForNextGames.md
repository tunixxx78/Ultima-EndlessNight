# Ultima-EndlessNight
 3D-EndlessRunner

This is my first real project in 3d world.
This game is inspired by my current place to work(restaurant Ultima) and a pacman.
Rough idea is -> player must eat as many pieces of cheese, salamis, pizzas as he can's before angry chef will catch him.
Every time you eat one piece - angry chefs moving speed will increase and and every moves will get sharper and sharper.
This thing will be really addictive, based on user feedback from my friends and other people who have tried it.

My part in this project will be writing all code, to be a gamedesigner, and i think i need to do some 3d-modeling for some static game objects.

I will give this project few months to get it to demo phase. If after that it wont work i will ditch it.

But if/when if will finnish this project i have platform to release it waiting for. Finnished product can be find in restaurant ultimas web-site.
But in this point really rough prototype version can be found and tried from itch.io -> under username tunixxx78.
